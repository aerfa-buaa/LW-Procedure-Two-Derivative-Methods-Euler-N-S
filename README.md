# LW-Procedure-Two-Derivative-Methods-Euler-N-S.

This work we introduce a novel Lax-Wendroff type procedure for two-derivative time-
stepping methods on the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.

We introduce the explicit strong stability preserving
(SSP) two-derivative time-stepping schemes, including the two-derivative
Runge-Kutta schemes and two-derivative multistep schemes, and the
optimal SSP coefficients of two-derivative time-stepping schemes are proposed in the 'SSP_time_stepping_schemes' folder.

We provide numerical examples using the two-derivative time-stepping methods along with the novel Lax-Wendroff procedure. 
The 'Linear' folder contains tests related to linear advection, 
while the 'Euler_N-S' folder includes numerical examples conducted on two-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes advection problems.
