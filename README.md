# LW-Procedure-Two-Derivative-Methods-Euler-N-S

This work we introduce a novel Lax-Wendroff type procedure for two-derivative time-
stepping methods on the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.

We introduce the explicit strong stability preserving
(SSP) two-derivative time-stepping schemes, including the two-derivative
Runge-Kutta schemes and two-derivative multistep schemes, and the
optimal SSP coefficients of two-derivative time-stepping schemes are proposed in the SSP_time_stepping_schemes folder.

The cases employ the two-derivative time-stepping methods with novel Lax-Wendroff type procedure are proposed.
On the Linear folder, the numerical examples are tested on the linear advection.
On the Euler_N-S folder, the numerical examples are tested on the two-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes advection.
